# Dead-End-Detector
Second Year Mini Project

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
Dead End Detector in road map is a system that is used to detect the presence of a dead end in a road network. It is typically integrated with a navigation system and is used to provide drivers with real-time information about the road network they are navigating. This system works by analyzing the road network data and identifying the presence of any dead end roads. When a dead end is detected, the system generates an alert to the driver, informing them that they have reached the end of the road and that they need to make a turn to continue their journey. This system helps drivers to avoid getting stuck in dead end roads and saves time and fuel by providing them with accurate navigation information.       

<h2> Use</h2>
In dead end detector there is a map of road network and we have to detect all the dead ends and to place the street signs.

<h4>Who can use?</h4>
    Dead End Detector project is a useful tool for drivers who are navigating unfamiliar road networks. It helps to minimize the risk of getting lost or stuck in dead end roads, which can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. With its real-time updates and accurate information, this system provides drivers with the confidence they need to reach their destinations smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, it reduces the need for drivers to double back, which can result in increased fuel consumption and decreased road safety. Thus, the Dead End Detector in road map is a valuable resource for drivers who want to make the most of their driving experience.
